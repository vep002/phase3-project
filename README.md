# My Garden Center - a plant care and tracking app

This app allows users to keep track of their plants' care needs. New users can create a user name and password. Once logged in, they can add plants to their virtual garden. Adding plants allows users to see care insructions for each plant. Users can also delete a plant from their virtual garden. All changes are persisted to the Sinatra API backend database.
